The Crawler Arcade Game was written in JavaScript and rendered via a browser in HTML. It uses the canvas of HTML5 for rendering the game. 

The game is initiated by calling the index.html file from any browser that accepts the JavaScript and is able to interpret HTML5.

In the game, a grid of blocks is display as the main board, it has 7 rows and 7 columns. The top row is the water, the next four rows are the stone (or street) and the last two rows are the grass or "safe" zone. 

Enemies (bugs) will appear only in the stone rows and will run at different speed from left to right, but be careful, because the bugs will change speed with no warning.  

The game consist of a single player that starts in the bottom of the grid in the safe zone, and must go up the street to the top row (water) without colliding with any enemy (the bugs).

The rocks in the street cannot be jump over or step on, they must be circumvented. 

The player wins the game by reaching the top. A reward of 100 points is awarded each time the players reaches the top safely, but if the player is caught by a bug, 100 points are subtracted from his/hers score as a penalty.

In addition, the player can earn extra points by collecting gems. Each color of gem has a different value in points. The blue gem is worth 150, the green gem 250 and the orange gem is 350. 

The gems may appear randomly each time the player wins a game.

As a bonus, the player can choose a different avatar for his/hers character by cliking on any image in the left column of the game board.

Thanks for playing. He hope you enjoy the game.
